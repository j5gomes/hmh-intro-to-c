I need to study algebra
C is s low lever language
ASM mathes the C. You can read this
How things really work is worth knowing
I WANT TO KNOW WHATS GOING ON

### What is a variable "really"?

- Put the variable in the watch window

### Shortcuts
- CTRL+SHIFT+B = Build
- F5 -> Debug
- SHIFT+F5 -> Stop debug
- F9 -> breakpoint
- F10 -> Step over
- Right click > Go to dessasembly
- Bebug > Windows > Watch -> open debug watch window- Debug > Windows > Registers -> Open registers
- Hover over hex in assembly to see its decimal value

### Number types

```
char Small;
short Medium;
int Large;
```

### Binary

Computer work with bits (1 and 0)

```
char SmallS; // 8 bits - 256 different values [-128,127]
char unsigned SmallU; // 8 bits - 256 different values [0,255]

short MediumS; // 16 bits - 65536
short unsigned MediumU;

int LargeS; // 32 bits - 4 billion
int unsigned LargeU;
```

### Assembly

- Is really good to know how to ready assembly

**Registers**

- Representation of the registers of the CPU
- Code instructions to the CPU

  Gets some memory > pull in to an register > as command that can operate to change the values > as commands to put does values again in mmemory (GB RAM)

**Instructions**

mov -> move - move memory from one place to another
